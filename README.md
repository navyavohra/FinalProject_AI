# FinalProject_AI
Final project of AI.

In this research project, we used pycaret using pycaret.classification. Imported data from pycaret repository, setting up the environment in pycaret and built multiclass models. Created a model for top 3 models, performing stratified cross validation and evalated classification matrics. Where, the top models for the data Wine Quality for Red wine in classification are extra tree classifier, Random forest Classifier, Light Gradient Boosting Machine On the basis of Most accuracy, AUC etc. Using the code compare_model(). Then tuned the models , automatically tune the hyper-parameters of multiclass model. Plotted models for the top 3 models, confusion matrix, classification report, Decision Boundary plot, and prediction error Plot. Then Finalized the best model, predicted on new/unseen data. And Finally saved a model for our future use.
